# Intro to Unity - Village 


## What you built? 

We attempted to build a village scene in Unity with an interactive experience. The tutorial we followed included basic setup of our Unity project, the basics of navigating around some of the key tools in Unity, and the actual content of building the experience. The final product was a village scene in which a player (the user wearing a headset) can walk around and interact with various blocks in the village. 

The construction component of the tutorial was split up into 3 main parts-- set-up, grounds, interactives. 

The set-up part consisted of creating a new scene and setting up a ground and walls for our village.

Next, we populated our scene with some houses:

## Who Did What?

Part 1 of the tutorial was mostly setup, so both Donia and Wylie had to download various packages to ensure that their local machines had the valid packages for this tutorial. 
Donia did part 2 & 3, which involved constructing the scene with a basic set and "building the grounds" (i.e. building the houses to populate the village). 
Wylie did part 4, which consisted of adding interactable objects that the user can pick up and play with, when viewing the scene through a VR headset. 

## What you learned

We learned a lot about using Unity and navigating around the UI. Honestly, it took a while to get used to the different keyboard commands for navigation, orientation, and manipulating the size of the various objects. Donia had never used or interacted with Unity before, and there was definitely a learning curve to get used to the platform. 

One major frustration in the process was that it took a ridiculous amount of time to set up Donia's Unity project. For some reason, the XR plug-ins necessary for the tutorial would not even show up as packages to be added, and it took maybe 30-40 minutes just to get them to show up. Julian (the author of the tutorial) was also very confused.
